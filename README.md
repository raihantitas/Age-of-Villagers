# Age of Villagers
This repository is the detail of a Design Patterns Assignment for SWE 17.  

You need to build part of a game named _Age of Villagers (AoV)_. The game is about people from different parts of the world trying to build their villages. The game has a lot of features, of which you need to focus only on the village creation part. Therefore all the user stories are assumed to be of a _village editor_ user role.

A village can have several types of objects like _house_, _tree_ and _water source_. There are also several nations available. Based on the nation, the objects may look different. For example, the house of the Inuits can be an igloo, whereas the house of the Bedouin can be a tent.

The detailed requirements are in the issues of the repository. Please go through this document and all the issues carefully.

## How to Submit
**PLEASE FOLLOW THIS PROPERLY.**  
1. Create a branch in this repository with your two-digit Student ID and Nickname. 
   1. For example, Tanvir's branch should be `06-tanvir`. Use **all lowercase** characters.
   2. There is a hyphen in between your ID and name.
   3. If your ID is one digit, use a leading zero.
2. Create a folder in the `solutions` folder with the same as your branch name. Write everything in this folder only.

1. The _Minimum_ criteria must be fulfilled to consider your assignment to be submitted.
1. **Constraints**: Documented here: [#2](/../../issues/2).
1. **Tagging Commits**: Use this format to tag your commits with an issue: #issue-number. For example #512.
1. **Tagging Refactoring Commits**: There is a special issue ([#1](/../../issues/1)) for refactoring commits. Make sure you use this tag when refactoring. Otherwise, it will not be considered as refactoring.
1. **Milestones**: The tasks are associated with milestones. Find the issues with milestones here:
   1. [Minimum](/../../issues?q=milestone:Minimum)
   1. [Average](/../../issues?q=milestone:Average)
   1. [Good](/../../issues?q=milestone:Good)
   1. [Excellent](/../../issues?q=milestone:Excellent)

## How to Communicate
1. If your query is related to an issue, comment below the issue.
1. If it is a general question, comment below the discussion issue: [#3](/../../issues/3)
1. Please do not discuss any solution approach in the discussion threads. Only ask for clarification. If you think your query will disclose a solution approach, please contact your course teachers privately.

## Notes
1. Some parts of the assignment may be changed later. Make sure you watch this repository so that you get notification of any changes. Specially, some more tickets will be added.
1. This is a design patterns assignment. That means code quality is very important. However, implementing functionality comes first.
1. Implement only what has been asked. Implementing anything outside requirements does not give you any extra credit.
